# SDP Exchange Failed: 404 Error - Debugging Context

## Problem
- Error: "SDP exchange failed: 404"
- Type: WebRTC connection error
- Context: Session Description Protocol exchange failing with HTTP 404 status

## Current Status
Testing solutions systematically to identify and fix the root cause.

## Root Cause Identified
The code is incorrectly using `/chat/completions` endpoint for WebRTC SDP exchange. This is a text chat API endpoint, not a WebRTC signaling endpoint.

Line 370 in sidepanel.js:
```javascript
endpoint: `${grokEndpoint}/chat/completions`, // Wrong endpoint for WebRTC
```

## Solution Found
**Grok API does not support WebRTC/SDP exchange for real-time voice.**

The extension is trying to use Grok API for WebRTC voice interaction, but:
- Grok only has REST API endpoints (no WebRTC support)
- OpenAI has WebRTC support at `https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`
- The code needs to be modified to either:
  1. Use OpenAI API instead of Grok for voice features
  2. Use Grok's regular chat API without WebRTC (text-only)

## Fix Implemented
Modified the extension to properly support OpenAI's WebRTC API for voice features:

1. **Updated getEphemeralToken() function** (lines 351-386):
   - Now detects API key type (OpenAI vs Grok)
   - Configures OpenAI endpoint for WebRTC: `https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`
   - Shows clear error message if trying to use Grok for voice

2. **Updated README.md**:
   - Clarified that voice features require OpenAI API
   - Added instructions for both OpenAI and Grok setup
   - Updated troubleshooting section with SDP error solution

## Progress Log
- Created context file: Starting systematic debugging
- Found WebRTC code at line 2855-2865 in sidepanel.js
- Traced endpoint to getEphemeralToken() function at line 351
- **IDENTIFIED ISSUE**: Wrong endpoint being used (chat/completions instead of WebRTC endpoint)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Grok API doesn't support WebRTC - need to use OpenAI instead
- **SOLUTION APPLIED**: Modified code to use OpenAI API for voice features
