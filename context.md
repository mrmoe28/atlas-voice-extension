## Previous: Extension Icon Loading Error Fix

## Issue
Extension fails to load with error: "Could not load icon 'assets/icon-16.png' specified in 'icons'"

## Root Cause
The assets folder was completely empty - all icon files referenced in manifest.json were missing.

## Fix Progress
1. ✅ Checked working directory - in correct atlas-voice-extension folder  
2. ✅ Created context tracking file
3. ✅ Checked manifest.json - references icon-16.png, icon-48.png, icon-128.png, mic.svg
4. ✅ Verified assets folder was empty
5. ✅ Created all missing icon files:
   - icon-16.png (16x16 blue circle with 'A')
   - icon-48.png (48x48 blue circle with 'A') 
   - icon-128.png (128x128 blue circle with 'A')
   - mic.svg (microphone icon)
6. ✅ Verified all required assets now exist
7. ✅ Packaged extension for testing (extension.zip created)
8. ✅ Pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/mrmoe28/atlas-voice-extension

## Solution Summary
Successfully fixed the extension loading error by creating all missing icon files.
The extension should now load without any icon-related errors.

## Second Error Fix - Service Worker Registration Failed
- Error: Service worker registration failed with status code 3
- Cause: background.js imported './lib/update-manager.js' which didn't exist
- Fix: Created the missing update-manager.js module in lib/ directory
- The extension should now load completely without errors
